# Game Progression
## Starter Chapter

A cliff type thing which can't be crossed on the left.
Simple platforming to the right teaching the movement.
There will be some strands of darkness that start showing up as the player proceeds to the right.
Two/Three rooms later, if the player is too slow, darkness comes from behind and kills the player.
Once the player reaches the end of that room, there's a near solid wall with the dark thingys, and then a cutscene where the player raises the fragmented orb that makes some cool effects and causes the darkness to be blown away.
The player proceeds through the now open wall and then the darkness starts to come back

End of cutscene

## Chapter 1
The orb currently just functions like a light. The darkness has come back slightly but is almost unnoticable at the start.

The surroundings appear to be in ruins.

The general progression of the rooms is towards the right and upwards.

The player is required to do some pretty simple platforming to proceed at the start. There are more and more of the dark creatures and a new creature is introduced which does ranged attacks. The player still has no way to kill them as of now.

The general progression of the rooms changes to straight downwards.

After a few rooms, the darkness seems to come alive and starts chasing the player from the top.

A few rooms later is the final room of chapter 1. This room is huge and contains another fragment of the orb at the bottom. The player must get to the get to the orb, triggering a cutscene.

Cutscene: once the player aquires the orb fragment, it fits into the current incomplete orb. The fragments release blinding light that remove the darkness and destroys the floor, causing the player to fall through.

## Game Story - Old
the main character has always been facinated by exploration and history, and while rummaging through an old antique shop, the mc stumbled upon a strange, ancient fragment. It was made of some unknown material, and it seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy. Despite the shopkeeper's warning that the fragment was cursed, Lara couldn't resist the urge to take it home with her.

As the mc held the fragment in her hands, mc felt a strange pull towards a distant land. mc couldn't shake the feeling that the fragment was leading her to something important, something hidden deep within the ancient ruins of a far-off civilization.

Determined to follow the fragment's lead, mc set off on a journey to the ruins. The ancient ruins were shrouded in mystery, and for centuries, archaeologists and adventurers had sought to uncover their secrets. It was said that the ruins held the power to bend reality itself, and those who braved their depths could bend the world to their will.

Or the mc meets an NPC that gives the orb.

As mc explored the ruins, mc couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air seemed thicker, the shadows longer, and the very stones seemed to shift and move under your feet.

At first, mc chalked it up to nerves and the unknown, but as mc delved deeper into the ruins, the strange sensations only grew stronger. The fragment is also visibly reacting to the energy. Suddenly you find yourself standing in a room filled with glowing, pulsing energy. Some of the energy appears to be sinister, and some of it seems to be inviting. A mix of black, white, red, orange, blue, and more colors. You see a logbook which has some old faded writing about explorers that were there previously and them preparing for the worst as they went in. The explorers called the orb a rift in space that was the pathway to the Nexus. As you move further into the room, there's a dark orb that starts pulling you in. At a point, it becomes inescapable and sucks you in, and the world around you began to shift and change.

After you regain consciousness, you find yourself standing in a completely different place, with ancient structures and unfamiliar landscapes stretching out before you. You had no idea where you were, and your watch was behaving unpredictably. You understood that the ancient ruins had somehow transported you through time and space.

As you explored this strange new world, you began to realize that the ruins were not just a place of ancient history, but a gateway to incredible and unimaginable powers. There were also sinister powers lurking by. You adventure in this area for a few days finding new powers and strange abilities through battles and exploration. As you explore this place, the darkness grows deeper and ends with meeting the power responsible for destroying the city and creating the ruins.

After a terrifying boss fight, the darkness is removed and light starts to pear into the ruins. Some sprits are released which thank you for vanquishing the darkness and bringing them peace. You find a panel where you insert your fragment and it teleports you back home. The end.
