                    <h2>Real-Time Hardware Accelerated Raytracing in Vulkan</h2>
                    <p>
                        By leveraging hardware acceleration, I built a renderer capable of physically accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections without compromising on frame rates. I also architected a custom heat-map tool to visualize BVH traversal costs, ensuring the system wasn't just visually stunning, but mathematically efficient.

                    <h2>GPU-Driven 6 Million Particle Simulation</h2>
                    <p>
                        My goal for this project was to push the GPU to its absolute limit. I engineered a high-performance simulation pipeline using compute shaders, indirect drawing, sorting, culling, and more optimizations to handle over 6 million particles simultaneously. By rigorously profiling memory access patterns through <strong>NVIDIA Nsight</strong>, I optimized the system to maintain a stable, playable framerate without creating CPU bottlenecks.

                    <h2>Custom Engine Indie Game Shipped on Steam</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is a massive difference between a tech demo and a shipped product. As the Technical Lead for Knuckle Knockout, I was responsible for bridging that gap. I architected our OpenGL post-processing stack to achieve our unique visual style and wrote a low-latency audio system to ensure combat felt responsive. Seeing players actually enjoy a game running on code I wrote from scratch was one of the most rewarding moments of my career.
